I am an artist situated in Naarm, currently in the Nicholas Building. It is important to me to seek ways to communicate ourselves freely outside of the institution with others who act with love and intention. The internet is a dream.
<br> You can view my work <a href="list.html">HERE</a>, or access my <a href="list.html">web experiments</a>. Otherwise return <a href="index.html">home</a>.
